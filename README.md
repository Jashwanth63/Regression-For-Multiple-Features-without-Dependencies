This does not use sklearn or any other packages that have an existing implementation for linear regression. I have written this from scratch, step-by-step to learn how linear regression and by virtue, how gradient descent and loss optimization works.
This can be generalized to other ML algorithms as well. 

The point of this project is to solidify my understanding of the working of an ML algorithm.
